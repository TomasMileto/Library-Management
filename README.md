# Library-Management
Basic Manager Program for a Library made with C#.

Made this simple program with an University peer (Nicol√°s Rosello) for the subject "Programming III". I learned how to properly delagate and subdivide the code in different classes, making use of static members, interfaces, functional programming and switch-cases.


## How to install 

1. Unzip the "publish" compressed file
2. Run "setup.exe"
3. Run "setup.exe" or "Libreria.exe" to execute the console app
