# Library-Management
Basic Manager Program for a Library made with C#.

Made this simple program with an University peer (Nicol√°s Rosello) for the subject "Programming III". I learned how to properly delagate and subdivide the code in different classes, making use of static members, interfaces, functional programming and switch-cases.
